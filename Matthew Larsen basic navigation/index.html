        <h1>Smartphones being used in class</h1>

        <br>I think smartphones have a place in the classroom becuase they can provide additional help to kids working and an easy accesible source to the internet if computers are not avalible. Kids can also easily share work and information via AirDrop, texting and many other messenging services.Many students already have these devices so why cant they use them to benifit there learning rather than buying a computer which does the same/ very similar to a smartphone.You can get many reading apps such as iBoooks or Kindle on your smartphone so you do not need books in class. Without using phones we are putting ourselves at a disadvantage in schools. If we can look at our phones during school, any questions or issues that interest us we can just look them up. All the information we would ever need would be at our fingertips on our smartphones and so this is wy i think smartphones should be allowed in classrooms.
